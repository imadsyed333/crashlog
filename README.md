</h1>

<h2>The Vision</h2>
Being involved in a vehicle collision is stressful. It becomes hard to think clearly and log important information, especially if there is nobody there to guide you. Local police departments have rolled out online forms to help drivers log info, but they are cumbersome, and require online connections. 

Crashlog is meant to be a simple and secure mobile app to guide drivers when logging critical details about their vehicle collisions. Every page, every step is broken down and displayed in a way that should be easy to understand and parse for the user, despite the chaos of their current situation.
